## Day 3
 Watch Tutorial on FCN model for segmentation. In this particular tutorial they used [kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshaymahna/kittiroadsegmentation) for road and and did segmentation on it. 
 And the notebook can be find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshaymahna/fully-convolutional-network) which was used in the original tutorial.
 
 I learned about the various techniques used for upsampling and how they are used. I also learned about the method used to convert a VGGNET Architecture to get segmentation mask. Here in particular we used last three pooling layers to add the information with upsampling to get the mask for segmentation task.
